DigitalReplica is a single-member LLC, created by Danny Rappleyea to hack the world.

I've hacked into...a lot of things. All perfectly legal and ethical as a penetration tester. Banks, casinos, power grids, a medium-ish city, and so on. Immense fun!

Now I'm turning that hacking mentality to the world, society, our legal structure. And finding that it's just as much fun, and there's far fewer people doing it.

So follow along, join in, and have some fun too.
